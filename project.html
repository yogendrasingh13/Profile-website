                    <h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>
                    <p>The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player game that is played on a 3x3 grid. Each player takes turns placing their mark (X or O) in a cell. The first player to get three of their marks in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game. If all 9 cells are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a tie. The logic behind the Tic Tac Toe game is relatively simple. Each player starts with 9 moves. If a player can place three of their marks in a row, they win the game. If a player cannot place three of their marks in a row, and all 9 cells are filled, the game is a tie.</p>

                    <p>The Snake game is a classic arcade game that is played on a grid. The goal of the game is to control a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The player controls the snake's movement using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The snake's body is made up of a series of blocks. The snake can grow longer by eating food. Food is represented by a small circle that appears at random locations on the grid. When the snake eats food, it grows by one block.   </p>
